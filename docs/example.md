If you want to play with the API but don't feel like trying it on a real app, you can run the example project. Clone the repo, go to the `Example/` folder and run:
```bash
  yarn install
```

Then run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` (depending on which platform you want to run the example app on).

You will need to have an Android or iOS device or emulator connected as well as `react-native-cli` package installed globally.
